                            Piceno LLC offers two different lines of Colli Ripani wines. The new, premier Linea 508 is named in reference to the altitude above nearby sea level in meters for the Commune of Ripatransone. The entry level line is enumerated “0” through “9” and is entitled by the various grape varietals for the respective wines. Following below are the six wines that constitute Linea 508. The new Line 508 labels depict various historical and mythological scenes from the Commune of Ripatransone … with each, a special insight into the storied past of the “Belvedere dei Piceni”.

                                <p>This is a back to the future Pecorino … a great effort by Adriano Lorenzi to re-create the classic version of this ancient grape. It is made with very little filtration and is tapped directly from the oak barrel. It presents a golden yellow hue from summer along with slight greenish reflections. Fruity, floral, and persistent, its persistence works wonderfully with tasty cheeses, roasted fish, pork, and spicy dishes.</p>

                                Established in 1963, the Celli Vineyard belongs to the Sirri and Casadei families. The two fathers were nicknames “Bron” and Rusèval from whence the vineyard’s premier line of wines draws its brand name. In 1985, they start renovating all of the wine-making systems and established a new company philosophy:  the continuous pursuit of quality with an emphasis on the local wine traditions. In 1995, the company greatly expanded its production capabilities through the purchase of additional land and the planting of new vines.
                            </p>

                            <p>Celli cultivates its vineyards with great care and meticulous attention to the Advanced Integrated Pest Management regulations of the European Community. (CEE 1698/05).</p>

                            <p>
                                Celli does not use any kind of chemical herbicides. In addition, the sulphite content of its wines is well below the maximum limits allowed in organic wines.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At present, Celli carefully select grapes from 30 hectacres of vineyards located in the most valued areas of Bertinoro municipality, most of all from the farm “La Maestrina” in Casticciano, Tenuta La Massa in Massa, Campi di Fratta in Fratta Terme, and Campi di Bracciano in Bracciano.

                                The soil and climate contribute to provide more clearly differentiation in the quality and range of wines. Favored by this outstanding geography and by the quality of the soil, Bertinoro, which is located in the province of Forlì-Cesena in the Romagna hills, is considered an important and well-known wine-producing center.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Bertinoro is known as the “Balcony of Romagna” for its splendid view of the Adriatic Sea and the luscious green hills that open behind the town center. It is a spectacularly beautiful historic village which has kept its ancient buildings in excellent condition, highlighted buy cobbled alleys, excellent trattorias, interesting museums, and a large conference center.

                    <div class="col-lg-8">
                        <p>Alberto Quacquarini is a small family-owned and operated vineyard from the beautiful mountainside Commune of Serrapetrona, which lies west of Macerata snuggled against the eastern slopes of the Appenine Mountains. It is thought to be the smallest Italian appellation.</p>

                        <p>Founded by Alberto and his wife, Francesca, the vineyard now is run by their three children:  Monica, Luca, and Mauro. Quacquarini is the leading maker of Vernaccia di Serrapetrona DOCG that is produced on 35 hectares planted with the Vernaccia Nera grape.</p>

                        <p>
                            According to Italian wine expert, Ian D’Agata (Native Wine Grapes of Italy):  “All told, Vernaccia Nera grown in this remote and small corner of the Marche can produce some of Italy’s greatest wines, but sadly, also some of the least known.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Their signature spakling Vernaccia – both dry and sweet version – is the finest the appellation has to offer. In accordance with Italian wine law, it is produced with a minimum of 85% Vernaccia Nera grapes … 40% of which must be air dried … a passito method that is part of Quacquarini’s triple fermentation process.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The intense quality of the signature sparkling wines is obtained in places of semi-darkness where the grapes are hung and left to dry for 3 months. Thee must from these grapes is fiery ruby red, sweet and thick like honey. This is added to ferment with the October fresh-picked grapes. Further fermentation produces the sparkling wine. Yet a longer in-bottle fermentation produces the dry version.
                        </p>

                                    This wine is produced using the Vernaccia Nera grape, a plant with little foliage and few grapes, producing only 8,000 KG of grapes per hectare (2.2 acres). Vernaccia Nera is a scarce grape, for certain, but its aromatic quality and exception quality provides a rare allure. It waves of velvety smooth flavors delicately roll across your palate.  100% Vernaccia Nera. As an aperitif or at the end of the meal with cheeses or gli dolci. D’Agata rates Quacquarini:  ***. That’s the best of the best.

                                    Welcome to the non-sparkling world of Vernaccia Nera. This wine is crafted from 100% Vernaccia Nera grapes that are dried for only up to two months. One would expect a very intense wine given this process but the result is a surprisingly smooth full-body red with complexity and, of course, wonderful bouquet. This wine is pretty special.

                        <p>From the Vulture appellation of the southern region of Basilicata --- renowned for its volcanic soils --- comes the prodigal female winemaker, Elena Fucci. Hailed this year as among the “15 Women in Wine to Watch” by Food and Wine Magazine, she and her husband, Andrea, concentrate on one grape and one wine --- Aglianico. Her 16-year record as an enologist is without comparison. Robert Parker refers to Elena Fucci as the “ascending star of a wine region in the deep south of Italy”.  Elena Fucci makes a mere 28,000 bottles of each year. They are quickly sold out.</p>

                        <p>Elena Fucci’s new vineyard is made completely from recycled materials and owns a zero-carbon footprint, evidence of her family’s commitment to its wine and the Earth’s health.</p>

                                    The 2013 vintage of the Riserva was Elena Fucci’s first. It comes only in a 1.5 Liter bottle of which there are only 400. Robert Parker rated it a 97 and gushed effusively:  “A new benchmark wine for southern Italy has just been created.” Yes, it is full-bodied, but with a grace and subtlety characterized by a complexity and an incredibly lengthy, smooth finish. A wine to be savored.

                        <p>For four generations, the Tabarrini family has been nestled into the gently rolling eastern part of Umbria outside of Montefalco and in the morning shadows of the Appenine Mountains. In the late 1990s, Giampaolo Tabarrini put decades of the family’s expertise to use with the creation of their own wines. He now makes some of the most highly-respected and appreciated wines in Central Italy, earning him recognition as “The Rising Star of Umbria”.</p>

                        <p>Tabarrini is annually well-rated for its single-vineyard Sagrantino wines … three of them. These are true craft production, less than 4,000 bottles from each vineyard. The vineyard draws upon the passion, skills, and commitment of the entire family:  Federica, the wife of Giampaolo; Giampaolo’s parents, Franca and Nello; Daniele Sassi, the vineyard’s marketing director; Zio Angelo Tabarrini and Arturo Zarzycki, who tend to the wine production process; and Stefano Dini, the consulting agronomist.

                                    The best Sagrantino grapes come from the Montefalco appellation and Tabarrini labors over their three, small-production Sagrantino grapes. The Campo alla Cerqua is the smallest with only 1,800 bottles made each year. Parker rated it a 92 and praised its “developed and focused bouquet with clear mineral imprinting behind plum red fruit and exotic spice.” Veronelli also gave it a 92. Ready to drink now but like all of Tabarrini’s Sagrantino vintages, it gets better with time in your cellar.

                                    A full-bodies Umbrian red blend of mostly Sangiovese but accompanied by Sagrantino and the flavorful Barbera. Wine Spectator gave the 2015 a 90 rating. Well-spiced, pleasant herbal notes (classic balsamic), and black cherry. For your everyday red wine needs.

                                    A combination of quince, Golden Delicious apple, and pear, it brought to mind for me a French Chablis. I thought but never said that aloud while tasting until winemaker, Gianpaolo Tabarrini, looked at me, smiled, and with a light laugh, said:  “Chablis, no?” I said:  “Yes.” And we laughed aloud. This is a special Trebbiano that accompanies all types of food from poultry to fish to pork. Parker gave it a 90+.
