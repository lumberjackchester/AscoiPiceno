                        <h4>THE REDS:  Absorbing the Marche Sun and Drawing Upon the Minerals of the Local Soils</h4>
                        <p>The basic ‘building block’ grapes of the Piceno areas historically were reds --- the full-bodied Montepulciano and the medium-bodied Sangiovese grape, which are combined into a blend known as Rosso Piceno Superiore and Rosso Piceno.</p>
                        <p>The Montepulciano is a vigorous, late-ripening grape that provides a deep ruby color and a fruity, ‘big red’ taste. It offers berry flavor and a chocolate texture that provides a wonderful compliment to red sauces and meats. [It is not to be confused with the DOCG Montepulciano originating in the Tuscan town that bears its name.]</p>
                        <p>The Sangiovese is one of the most prolific of all Italian varietals. The Sangiovese’s vigorous growth must be tempered by constant vineyard management in order to ensure that its tannins are both ripe and soft. It ripens late but keeps its natural acidity thus providing a fresh taste to a blend such as Rosso Piceno Supiore.</p>
                        <p>The Sangioves, but more frequently, the Montepulciano grapes are also combined with Cabernet Sauvignon or Petit Verdot to form blends known as Offida Rosso and Marche Rosso Rosso. Both of the above blends are often aged in French and Slovonian oak for periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. </p>

                        <h4>THE WHITES:  Cool micro-climates and sea breezes yield tropical fruit accents with fine acidic crispness</h4>
                        <p>White grapes have been the recent surprise in Piceno area. Led by the resurrection of the Pecorino grape and the refinement of the Passerina grape, the whites have proven a delicious compliment to the seafood dishes that comprise the famous coastal cuisine.</p>
                        <p>The Pecorino grape also exhibits the ability to sustain its vitality over three or four years, a wonderful, unusual characteristic for white wines. Some local vineyards have also begun to age it in French or Slovenia oak for up to 12 months.</p>
                        <p>Along with the Trebbiano grape, which is grown both in the Marche and Abruzzo regions, the Pecorino and Passerina grapes form a lovely “Falerio” blend. The Malvasia is also used in white table wine blends.</p>

                        <h4>Falerio (DOC)</h4>
                        <p>Falerio, known officially as Falerio dei Colli Ascolani, is a DOC blend unique to the Province of Ascoli Piceno. In fact, it is one of the southernmost DOCs in the Marche Region.</p>
                        <p>
                            The name of the DOC allegedly traces back to Roman times and draws its name from the ancient Roman city of Faleria (now the modern day commune of Falerone).
                            The Falerio blend combines many wines unique to the Marche region … somewhat rare Italian varietals that are seldom found elsewhere in Italy.
                        </p>
                        <p>Grapes used in the Falerio blend include Trebbiano Toscano (a maximum of 50% and minimum of 20%); Passerina (a maximum of 30% and minimum of 10%); and Pecorino (a maximum of 30% and minimum of 10%). Additionally, up to a maximum of 20% of other white varietals (e.g., Malvasia) can also be used.</p>
                        <p>Light yellow in color, the Falerio serves as refreshing appertif that accompanies fruit and cheeses. It has sound acidic structure and offers a clean, refreshing taste from initial sip to finish.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <h4>Passerina (DOC)</h4>
                        <p>Passerina is the Italian word for “sparrow”, a bird known to the country’s vinegrowers for its its appetite for ripe Passerina grapes. The suffix “—ina” means small, thus portraying the relative size of the grapes. </p>
                        <p>
                            Many researchers have attempted to determine the origin of this white varietal but have yet to reach a firm conclusion. It is thought to be a mutation of the Biancame (Bianchello) grape.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many vineyards in the Province of Ascoli Piceno, the southernmost of the Marche provinces, grow and bottle it as a stand-alone varietal, and also as part of the Falerio dei Colli Ascolani DOC blend, or utilize it for a lovely sweet wine, known locally as a ‘Passito’ (allowing the grapes to lose their moisture content on the vine and build up a high sugar level).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Passerina vines are mid-sized with pentagon-shaped leaves and small grapes that grow in medium to large clusters with thick skin. The wine is light yellow in color and normally presents a light banana and a ripe citrus taste. Passerina grapes have a high level of natural sugars and acidity, producing a very balanced wine that can be used as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to broil or roasted fish.
                            While also grown in the Abruzzo, Emilia-Romagna, and Lazio regions, the Passerina grapes of the Marche region are known to offer a sharper and with more intense minerality, likely attributable to the clay soils that characterize the Ascoli Piceno province.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Passerina – “Uva Passerina” --- name is attributed to those grapes that have small, often seedless berries. Yet as it is cultivated today, the Passerina has large berries, high yields, and a long ripening period. It is know also as “Pagadebito Gentile”, “Campolese”, and Trebbiano di Teramo (after the Terramo hills overlooking to the north the Tronto River valley that separates the Marche and Abbruzzo regions).

                        <h4>Pecorino (DOCG)</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <p>I &lsquo;met&rsquo; the Pecorino grape in 1991 on the second trip to my grandfather&rsquo;s hometown of Ripatransone, located in the Province of Ascoli Piceno at the southernmost reaches of the Marche Region. </p>

                        <p>Sent to Tenuta Cocci Grifoni by my cousin, Ido, a photojournalist at the time for Tuttoturismo magazine, he advised that Signor Guido Grifoni was making some excellent wines with local varietals. Ido praised Grifoni&rsquo;s Rosso Piceno Superiore, which was delicious, but it was I a white grape --- Pecorino --- that attracted my attention.</p>

                        <p>The Pecorino grape has been registered in the national catalogue of varieties since 1971 but was in danger of extinction because of limited interest among the area&rsquo;s vintners in its propagation. Native to the Ascoli Piceno area, its peculiar name is owed to the sheep that once grazed these mountain and valley environs (the sheep&rsquo;s milk that serves as the basis for the lovely variety pecorino cheese). </p>

                        <p>That day, Signor Grifoni described how he had discovered a crop (in 1982) of abandoned vines in the tiny municipality of Arquata del Tronto, just west of Ascoli Piceno, nestled along the Tronto River at the base of the Appenine Mountains. Over the ensuing 30 years, he achieved the coveted DOCG status for the Pecorino grapes he brought back to life in the tiny zone of Offida (having previously obtained the DOC status in 2001). </p>

                        <p>The foothills of the Sibillini Mountains, near to the provincial capitol of Ascoli Piceno, roll eastward to the Adriatic Sea. This land, rich in clay and other trace minerals, experiences a full four seasons of weather yet the Pecorino grape displays hardiness to the area&rsquo;s sometime harsh winters. Its bunches are irregularly shaped cones with small to medium-sized grapes that are spherical and possessed of thin, yet firm skin. Uncharacteristically for a white wine, it offers unusual longevity, storing safely for up to three to four years.</p>
                        <p>Pecorino has a straw lighter yellow color and possesses a spicy, fruity scent. Its flavor recalls ripe, tropical fruit with a touch of banana. While acidic, it is smooth from the start and displays a clean finish, making it a perfect accompaniment for seafood. As one writer has noted, in addition to the famous fish dishes of the Marche region, the Pecorino also compliments the province&rsquo;s cured meats such as the renowned Ciauscolo (a typical sausage of spreadable consistency).</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-4">

                    <div class="col-md-4">

                        <p>Another grower of the Pecorino grape, Adriano Lorenzi, winemaker at the Collevite vineyard in nearby Montsampolo, remarks that the cool-loving white grape benefits from the sea breezes. Of his Villa Piatti Pecorino, with grapes originating largely in his family&rsquo;s vineyard located in Ripatransone, Lorenzi says: &ldquo;Pecorino is a red wine with a white dress.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>According to the Tenuta Cocci Grifoni web site, the Pecorino provides &ldquo;&#8230;A balance of &lsquo;exaggerated&rsquo; figures for a wine born of a white grape vine: high sugar concentration, acids level over 8 G/L, PH around 3, and net dry extract greater than 24 G/L.</p>

                        <p>The following additional historical information about Guido Cocci Grifoni&rsquo;s work to resurrect the Pecorino grape is quoted directly the web site of Tenuta Cocci Grifoni):</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;In the early eighties, Guido Cocci Grifoni&rsquo;s research focused especially on native white varieties that could allow the production of wines other than the standard Trebbiano, Malvasia, and others. &#8230; Guido Cocci Grifoni began the bibliographic researched aimed at verifying the historical presence of ancient native white grape vines in the Piceno area.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;He did this with his friends and colleagues --- Giancarlo Moretti of Conegliano&rsquo;s Experimental Institute for Viticulture, Leonardo Seghetti of Ascoli Piceno&rsquo;s Agricultural Institute, and the noted Sommelier Teodoro Bugari, a person who was insrumetnal in the establishment the AIS Marche (the Marche Region Sommelier&rsquo;s Association).</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Their research revealed that north of the Tronto River, 1,000 meters above sea level, near Arquata del Tronto, there was a tiny, virtually abandoned vineyard that was owned, at the time, by an 80 year-old man. Grifoni recollected: &lsquo;One September morning in 1982, before the grape harvest, Giuseppe Frascarelli, Secretary of the Ascoli Piceno Chamber of Commerce, and the surveyor, Piergiorgio Liberati, and I traveled to Arquata del Trono, in the hamlet of Pescara. </p>

                        <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Mr. Cafini himself show us a few vine shoots from 2-3 generations. That morning, we just tagged some shoots with adhesive tape. The following February, I went back to pick up the shoots and brought them back to the farm. I did grafting with the collaboration of Benardo Lacnciotti, who owned a farm in Offida.&rsquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;The vines&rsquo; characteristics finally led to the decision to plant them in the northernmost area of the land. &#8230; The first sizable harvest goes back to 1990. &#8230; The first &lsquo;Mother Plants&rsquo; vineyard planted in the 80s is still in existence.&rdquo; </p>

                        <h4>Marche Rosso (IGT)</h4>
                        <p>The IGT, similar to the French Vin de Pays, is utilized by those producers not wanting to work within the confines of Italy&rsquo;s DOC regulations.&#160; The result is wines of high Montepulciano content that do not &lsquo;fit&rsquo; the required specifications for inclusion in DOC blends such as Rosso Piceno Superiore, Rosso Piceno, or a closely-related blend from the central Marche region, Rosso Conero. </p>

                        <p>The IGT categorization can also combine other red grape varieties. Prime examples of the Marche Rosso IGT are-- The outstanding Khorakhane from Cantine dei Colli Ripani, comprised for Montepulciano (95%) and Cabernet Sauvingnon (5%). Only 3,000 bottles made in the normal year!</p>

                        <p>-- Villa Piatti Marche Rosso from Collevite, comprised of Montepulciano (85%) and Petit Verdot (15%). </p>

                        <p>Both of these vineyards age their Marche Rosso for up to 18 months in French or Slovonian oak, producing a luscious feel and smooth tanins that result in light chocolate hints over a foundation of ripened red berries. </p>

                        <p>Along with the Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, varietals such as Merlot and Sangiovese also can be combined in varying percentages.</p>

                        <p>No two Marche Rosso IGTs are the same &#8230; attention to label details is a must! But that&rsquo;s the fun of it.</p>

                        <h4>Offida Rosso (DOC)</h4>
                        <p>Offida Rosso DOC is a red blend formed with a minimum of 50% Montepulciano and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, along with the possible presence of additional non-aromatic local red grapes. </p>

                        <p>The Offida Rosso blend has built a reputation for intensity, structure, and luscious taste that exhibits the finest qualities of the native local Montepulciano enhanced by the sophistication of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape. Many local vineyards choose to age the Offida Rosso with as much as 18 to 24 months in French or Slovonian oak. </p>

                        <p>Both the Leo Ripanus from Colli Ripani (70% - Montepulciano / 30% - Cabernet Sauvignon) and the Villa Piatti Offida Rosso from Collevite (70% - Montepulciano / 30% Cabernet Sauvignon) are outstanding examples of this blend.</p>

                        <p>The result is a perfume characterized by dark ripened cherries, currants, red fruits, and even a touch of black pepper.</p>

                            <strong>Rosso Piceno Superiore</strong> and
                            <strong>Rosso Piceno</strong> are red grape blends that combine two well-known Italian varietals, the Montepulciano and Sangiovese grapes. These were first recognized with the DOC designation in 1969.
                        </p>

                        <p>Wines with the &ldquo;Rosso Piceno&rdquo; or &ldquo;Piceno&rdquo; DOC title can be produced only with grapes that are grown in the Marche Region. According to the production standards of the Italian government, the percentages of the two main grape varietals in Rosso Piceno Superiore or Rosso Piceno must fall in the following ranges: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Montepulciano</strong>: from 35 to 85%;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sangiovese</strong>: from 15 to 50%.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The production zone of Rosso Piceno Superiore DOC is much smaller and comprises just the 13 southernmost towns of the Ascoli Piceno province. The clay soils of this area, combined with the south and southeast exposure of the selected vineyards, combine to expose the grapes to the hot summer sun that, in turn, produces wine with an intense red ruby color.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;The sun of central Italy bestows on the Superiore a tantalizing profume of cherry, currant, and dried plums,&rdquo; says Marco Pignotti, winemaker at the Cantine dei Colli RIpani. &ldquo;The balance and fullness of the wine perfectly compliment grilled meats.&rdquo;   The maximum production of grapes per hectare must not be more than 12 tons while the finished wine must ensure it has a minimum natural alcohol content of at least 11.5%. </p>

                        <p>The first Rosso Piceno Superiore to be sold in the marketplace was bottled by <a href="http://www.tenutacoccigrifoni.it/">Tenuta Cocci Grifoni</a> in San Savino di Ripatransone (AP) in 1970, from grapes harvested in 1969. The estate is still among the most esteemed wine producers of the Piceno wine making region.</p>
                        <p>The warm, dry summers of the Ascoli Piceno Province allow for an intense concentration of sugar, aided by the fact that the grapes can be grown on long southern exposures on hills that run from west to east out of the Appenine Mountains toward the Adriatic Sea. The province averages rainfall of 750 mm and has mainly clay soil that is rich in trace minerals, but which is also capable of quickly draining any excess water, thanks to both the slopes and the permeability of the ground itself.</p>
