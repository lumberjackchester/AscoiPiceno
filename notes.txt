The name of the DOC allegedly traces back to Roman times and draws its name from the ancient Roman city of Faleria (now the modern day commune of Falerone).  The Falerio blend combines many wines unique to the Marche region â€¦ somewhat rare 

Italian varietals that are seldom found elsewhere in Italy.
